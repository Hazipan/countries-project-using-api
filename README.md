## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was really cool. I've always wondered how to make requests to servers and this was the first step to integrating backend technology with my projects! I also learned a learned an important difference between class components and hooks. Class components have lifecycle methods, but hooked components don't. The useEffect method is all the lifecycle methods combined. Interesting stuff.

### Continued development

From here I'm going to build a few more project (at least one of which will also include an API), then I'm going to transition my learning to the backend! I'm really excited to start learning about servers and data bases.
